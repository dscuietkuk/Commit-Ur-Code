<h4>Question 2</h4>

Deepak is playing a computer game. Now he wants to complete the first level of this game.A level is a rectangular grid of 2 rows and n columns. <br>deepak  controls a character, which starts in cell <strong>(1,1) â€” at the intersection of the 1-st row and the 1-st column</strong>.deepakâ€™s character can move from one cell to another in one step if the cells are adjacent by side and/or corner.<br> Formally, it is possible to move from cell <strong>(x1,y1) to cell (x2,y2)</strong> in one step if <strong>|x1âˆ’x2|â‰¤1 and |y1âˆ’y2|â‰¤1</strong>.Obviously, it is prohibited to go outside the grid.There are traps in some cells. If deepakâ€™s character finds himself in such a cell, he dies, and the game ends.To complete a level, deepakâ€™s character should reach cell <strong>(2,n)â€” at the intersection of row 2 and column n.ðŸŽ¯</strong><br>
Help Deepak determine if it is possible to complete the level.

<strong>Input</strong>

The first line contains a single integer t <strong>(1â‰¤tâ‰¤100)</strong> â€” the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. Each test case consists of three lines.The first line contains a single integer n <strong>(3â‰¤nâ‰¤100)</strong> â€” the number of columns.<br>
The next two lines describe the level. The i-th of these lines describes the i-th line of the level â€” the line consists of the characters '0' and '1'. The character '0' corresponds to a safe cell, the character '1' corresponds to a trap cellðŸŽ¯.Additional constraint on the input: <strong>cells (1,1) and (2,n) are safe</strong>.<br>

<strong>Output</strong>

For each test case, output YES if it is possible to complete the level, and NO otherwise.<br>
