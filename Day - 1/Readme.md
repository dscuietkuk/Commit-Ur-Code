<h1 align="Center">🦘 Kangaroo & Distance Dilemma 🛣️</h1>
<h4>Question 1</h4>

A kangaroo🦘 starts at the point 0. In his first turn, he can make a jump of 1 unit. <br>
Now for all consequent turns, if the kangaroo is currently at a distance x <strong>(from the start)</strong>, his jump will take him x units forward. <br>
Given a point at a distance N, you have to find if the kangaroo can reach that point or not.
<br>

<strong>Input</strong>

First line will contain the number of test cases than T test cases followers, each test case contains a single line that contain single integer N.

<strong>Output</strong>

you have to find if the kangaroo can reach that point or not.if yes print “YES” else print “NO”.

<strong>Example 1:

Input:<br>
N = 3<br>
Output:<br>
NO<br>
Explanation:<br>
The kangaroo can't reach the position 3.<br>


Example 2:<br>
Input:<br>
N = 2<br>
Output:<br>
YES<br>
Explanation:<br>
The kangaroo will jump to position 1 in the first jump.<br>
Now, he is at a distance of 1 from the start, so he can jump 1 unit.<br>
So, he reaches the point 2.<br>
