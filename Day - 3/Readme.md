<h4>Question 3</h4>

You are given a special jigsaw puzzle🧩 consisting of n⋅m identical pieces. Every piece has three tabs and one blank, as pictured below.<br>

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/lorFDh7848zO22ogm33kDq6gyCo2s0RnZMrU-WrSstn-W6oVYotBquvPgzZO3iB5C8Na=s102" /></div>
<br>

The jigsaw puzzle is considered solved if the following conditions hold:<br>

1. The pieces are arranged into a grid with n rows and m columns.
2. For any two pieces that share an edge in the grid, a tab of one piece fits perfectly into a blank of the other piece.<br><br>

Through rotation and translation 🔁of the pieces, determine if it is possible to solve the jigsaw puzzle🧩.

<br>

<strong>Input</strong>

The test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains <strong> a single integer t (1≤t≤1000) </strong>— the number of test cases. Next t lines contain descriptions of test cases.<br>

Each test case contains two integers <strong> n and m (1≤n,m≤1e5) </strong>.<br>

<strong>Output</strong>

For each test case output a single line containing "YES" if it is possible to solve the jigsaw puzzle🧩, or "NO" otherwise.


<br>


<strong>Example :

Input:<br>
3<br>
1 3<br>
100000 100000<br>
2 2<br>
<br>
Output:<br>
YES<br>
NO<br>
YES<br>
