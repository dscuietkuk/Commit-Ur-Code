<h1 align="Center">✖️ Follow the Sequence ➕ </h1>
<h4>Question 0</h4>

Consider an algorithm that takes as input a positive integer N.<br>
If n is even, the algorithm divides it by two, and if n is odd, the algorithm multiplies it by three and adds one. The algorithm repeats this, until n is one.>br>
For example, the sequence for n=3 is as follows:
<h3 align="Center">3→10→5→16→8→4→2→1</h3>

Your task is to simulate the execution of the algorithm for a given value of n.<br>

<strong>Input</strong>

First line will contain number of test cases and each Test case contain an integer n.

<strong>Output</strong>

Print a line that contains all values of n during the algorithm for all test cases separated by newline.

<strong>Constraints</strong>
<h5>1<=T<=10</h5>
<h5>1≤n≤1e6</h5>
<strong>Example

Input:<br>
2<br>
3<br>
7<br>

Output:<br>
3 10 5 16 8 4 2 1<br>
7 22 11 34 17 52 26 13 40 20 10 5 16 8 4 2 1
